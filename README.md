## Hi there 👋


I’m self-taught and have been coding for several years - not for hype, but because I honestly enjoy solving problems.  
Mostly focused on **Go** now - I like its simplicity, speed, and the way it makes you think about design and performance.  
Also a big fan of **Linux** (currently use arch, btw) and love tweaking my setup until it feels perfect.  


### Tech & Tools
- **Languages:** Python, Go, Bash, sometimes JS for minor stuff
- **Backend:** Go stdlib, REST, Gin, Django REST
- **Infra / DevOps:** Docker, Linux, Git, GitHub Actions, basic AWS  
- **IDE / Terminal:** Neovim, Alacritty, tmux (VS Code only when I really have to)
- **Other interests:** networking, monitoring, security


### What I do
Right now I’m writing backend services in Go. Learning more about architecture, scalability, and distributed systems.  
Sometimes I build small side projects just to test ideas or break things on purpose to see how they work.


### Goals
- Get a backend role focused on Go  
- Improve in low-level stuff: networking, systems, performance  
- Contribute to open source and build something useful for others  


if you’re into Go, backend stuff, or systems in general, I’d be glad to connect.
